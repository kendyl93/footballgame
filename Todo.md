## ToDo ideas

1. Create Team to choose
2. Every player will get their own rank with own points, and overall teams will have sum of all players who chose the same team. i.e player 1 have chosen RealMadrit and he has 18 pts. Second player have hosen also the RealMadrit and have 2 points. From now on the RealMadrit team has 20pts.
3. Players will have a PvP with others to get some points
4. PvP rules: 10s for each game, players will only click to their logo team to get points. Player with more points after 10s will win.
